# Thunderstorm
The project aims to be used to develop 2D games with minimal layers of abstraction, providing an out-of-the-box developer experience. We also prioritize performance, ensuring that your games can run almost anywhere.
## Third Party Technology
We use [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) as our graphics API, and also [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) for window handling, context creation, and some utilities.
## Build Instructions
First of all you need to install the [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) programming language. Once you have done it you only need to execute the following commands:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ivansouzamf/Thunderstorm.git
cd Thunderstorm
```
If you are on linux:
```sh
./build.sh debug
```
If you are on windows:
```bat
.\build.bat debug
```
